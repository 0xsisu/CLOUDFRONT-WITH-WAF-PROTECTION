#### CLOUDFRONT WITH WAF PROTECTION 2023

This lab project is based on tutorial by [Ben Potter, Security Lead, Well-Architected](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_cloudfront_with_waf_protection/)

The tutorial is from 2018. Since then AWS updated the console, therefore I had to create a different flow of instance creation, security groups, roles. Also Apache Web Server installation for Linux 2 instance was done differently. I hope you will enjoy following the updated version. I had a lot of fun :).

#### Lab Level: 200 Intermidediate 

#### Description
According to Cloud Threat Report, Unit 42â„¢ which is based on analysis of 210,000 cloud accounts across 1,300 different organizations in 76% of organizations MFA is not enforced for console users, and 58% of organizations don't enforce MFA for root/admin users.
In this lab I wil be demonstrating what I;ve learned from Ben Porter's 200 Level Lab tutorial

#### Goals
Protecting network and host-level boundaries
System security configuration and maintanance
Enforcing service-level protection

#### Services & concepts used:

EC2
Amazon CloudFront
AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Defence in Depth

#### Steps:

* Launch Instance EC2
* Configure AWS WAF
* Cofigure Amazon CloudFront
* Tear down this lab

#### Launch instance 

1. EC2 service -> Launch Instance (top right):
* Name: cloudfront_with_waf
* AMI: Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
* Instance Type: t2.micro

* Key Pair (login): create new key_pair

* Network settings (expand)
* Create security group: cloudfront_with_waf_sec_group (can be done after I prefer to be done with it here)
* Description: sec group for cloudfront with waf
* Inbound Security Group Rules:
 * Type: SSH Source, Type: My IP
 * Type: HTTPS Source, Type: Anywhere
 * Type: HTTPS Source, Type: Anywhere

**Note that best practice is to have an Elastic Load Balancer inline or the EC2 instance not directly exposed to the internet. However, for simplicity in this lab, we are opening the access to anywhere. Other lab modules secure access with Elastic Load Balancer.**

* Create New Role:

* After you create a Role it's time to add it to our instance and click Update:

* Connect to instance via SSH use the pem key created earlier (same directory):

* run the following to install Apache Web Server:

> sudo yum update -y
>
> sudo yum install -y httpd
>
> sudo systemctl start httpd
>
> sudo systemctl enable httpd
>
> sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html
>
> usermod -a -G www ec2-user
>
> sudo vi /var/www/html/index.html
